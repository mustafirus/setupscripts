about LXC containers
if set network interfaces to static then /etc/interfaces, /etc/reslov.conf and fqdn in /etc/hosts set from WebUI
if set network interfaces to dhcp /etc/interfaces gets from dhcp, /etc/reslov.conf from dhcp, fqdn dont set in /etc/hosts,
hostname in /etc/hosts set to 127.0.1.1
to set fqdn from dhcp you need copy  setupscripts/scripts/setdomain to /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d and 
exec "ifdown eth0; ifup eth0" in shell but after reboot it resets to 127.0.1.1
so dhcp mode for LXC containers isnot an option
